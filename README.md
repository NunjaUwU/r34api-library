# R34 API Library
 The only R34 Rust Lib you need! (Just kiddingðŸ˜œ)

 With this lil library you can easily generate R34 api urls and parse
 json responses so you can use them to download content from R34.

 There is an example inside the documentation. I hope it's easy to understand.

# Projects with this Junk
 I made an R34 Downloader that kinda works but has no certificate or anything.
